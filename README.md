WokWhat

Class assignment: networking, needs server set-up to work see readme

This app does not work out of the box.  A network needs to be set-up.
1. Run the serverWokWhat.py from terminal by changing to its directory and typing "python serverWokWhat.py"
2. On your computer, go into network setting and copy the i.p. address you are using.  Replace the ip adress in the initNetworkCommunication method in SignInVC.m with the copied address.

Different users cook together on different iphones.  They add ingredients and pass it on with comments.

This is not an incredibly secure app.  It is a class assignment to get the feel of working with networks.
